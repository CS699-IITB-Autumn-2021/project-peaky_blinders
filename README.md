# Motivation

Most of the beginners trying to learn coding or especially data structure programming find it really difficult to visualise it.
The actual problem is with visualising what really happens in memory. Here we got our motivation to build something that could help
these newbies understand and learn how actually data structures and algorithms work.

# Problem Statement

  * Create a web application which shows animated visualization of

    1. Stacks (Basic operations, Application: Tower of Honoi)

    2. Queue (Basic operations, Application: Producer-Consumer Problem)

    3. Linked List (Basic operations, Application: Hashing with Chaining)

    4. Sorting Algorithms (Merge Sort, Insertion Sort)

    5. Searching Algorithms (Linear and Binary Search)

    In synchronization with code flow

  * Personalised Interface.

# Sell your product
  
  Gives you a complete pacakge of concept visualization and core code understanding.

# List of Features

 1. Different data structure animations in synchronization with code.

 2. Sorting and Searching algorithm's animations in synchronization with code.

 3. Personalised dashboard.

 4. History tracking for learning.

# Technology Stack

 1. HTML

 2. CSS

 3. JavaScript

 4. Python (Django Framework)

 5. Ace library

 6. MongoDB

# List of deliverables

  * Login and Registration Page.

  * Dashboard

  * Stack Tab : Basic Operations and Applications.

  * Queue Tab : Basic Operations and Applications.

  * Linked List Tab : Basic Operations and Applications.

  * Search Tab : Linear Search ,Binary Search.

  * Sorting Tab : Insertion Sort , Merge Sort.

# Hardware/Software Requirements

Installation of MongoDB and Python needed. On top of that need to follow the operating instructions to set up the server.

# How to Operate
Setting up the Server

  * **Install python**

  * **Install MongoDB**

  * **Goto project directory**

  * Run following command on terminal

    1. **pip install django**

    2. **pip install djongo**

Running the server

  **python manage.py runserver**

# Primary Stakeholders

 1. Beginners who wants to start learning data structures and algorithm.
 2. Anyone who wants to understand data structure and algorithm working in deep.
